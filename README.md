# RiftBoard

Logos tweak to pull SpringBoard on top of the current application. Configurable with Activator library, preferences with PreferenceLoader, etc.

Some code may be a little weird since this is from 2015.

Compatible with iOS 8-10. Apple has added some features from here into iOS 11 (dock anywhere) so it's sort of obsolete.
